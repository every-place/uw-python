Repository for my certificate program at the University of Washington: Certificate in Python Programming.



Welcome to my Python reposirtory for my UW Python programming certificate.
I am blessed to have this excellent education as I embark on my Python journey.
Most of my programming experience is self-taught, although I have had formal college classes in C++ and Java.

Previously, I started this repository for my prerequisite class: IT FDN 110 A Wi 24: Foundations Of Programming: Python

Take a look at the projects we have worked on in class.  I'm happy to share my experiences with you.

Best regards.

Aaron
